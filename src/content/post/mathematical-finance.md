# Mathematical Finance: From Black-Scholes to Modern Risk Models

Mathematical finance represents the intersection of probability theory, stochastic calculus, and financial economics. This field provides the theoretical foundation for modern risk management and derivative pricing.

## The Black-Scholes Model

The Black-Scholes equation is perhaps the most famous result in mathematical finance:

$$\frac{\partial V}{\partial t} + \frac{1}{2}\sigma^2 S^2 \frac{\partial^2 V}{\partial S^2} + rS\frac{\partial V}{\partial S} - rV = 0$$

Where:
- $V(S,t)$ is the option price
- $S$ is the underlying asset price
- $t$ is time
- $\sigma$ is the volatility
- $r$ is the risk-free interest rate

The solution for a European call option is:

$$C(S,t) = SN(d_1) - Ke^{-r(T-t)}N(d_2)$$

Where:

$$d_1 = \frac{\ln(S/K) + (r + \frac{1}{2}\sigma^2)(T-t)}{\sigma\sqrt{T-t}}$$

$$d_2 = d_1 - \sigma\sqrt{T-t}$$

## Risk Measures

### Value at Risk (VaR)

The Value at Risk at confidence level $\alpha$ is defined as:

$$\text{VaR}_\alpha(X) = \inf\{l \in \mathbb{R} : P(X \leq l) \geq \alpha\}$$

For a normal distribution, this simplifies to:

$$\text{VaR}_\alpha = \mu - \sigma \Phi^{-1}(\alpha)$$

Where $\Phi^{-1}$ is the inverse cumulative distribution function.

### Expected Shortfall

Expected Shortfall (also called Conditional VaR) is:

$$\text{ES}_\alpha(X) = \mathbb{E}[X | X \leq \text{VaR}_\alpha(X)]$$

## Portfolio Optimization

### Markowitz Mean-Variance Optimization

The optimal portfolio weights solve:

$$\min_{\mathbf{w}} \frac{1}{2}\mathbf{w}^T\Sigma\mathbf{w}$$

Subject to:
$$\mathbf{w}^T\mathbf{1} = 1$$
$$\mathbf{w}^T\boldsymbol{\mu} = \mu_p$$

Where:
- $\mathbf{w}$ is the weight vector
- $\Sigma$ is the covariance matrix
- $\boldsymbol{\mu}$ is the expected return vector
- $\mu_p$ is the target portfolio return

### Sharpe Ratio

The Sharpe ratio measures risk-adjusted returns:

$$\text{Sharpe Ratio} = \frac{R_p - R_f}{\sigma_p}$$

Where:
- $R_p$ is the portfolio return
- $R_f$ is the risk-free rate
- $\sigma_p$ is the portfolio standard deviation

## Stochastic Processes

### Geometric Brownian Motion

The most common model for asset prices:

$$dS_t = \mu S_t dt + \sigma S_t dW_t$$

Where $W_t$ is a Wiener process.

### Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Process

For mean-reverting processes like interest rates:

$$dr_t = \kappa(\theta - r_t)dt + \sigma dW_t$$

Where:
- $\kappa$ is the mean reversion speed
- $\theta$ is the long-term mean
- $\sigma$ is the volatility

## Monte Carlo Methods

### European Option Pricing

The Monte Carlo estimator for a European option:

$$\hat{V} = e^{-rT}\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N f(S_T^{(i)})$$

Where $f$ is the payoff function and $S_T^{(i)}$ are simulated asset prices.

### Confidence Intervals

For large $N$, the confidence interval is:

$$\hat{V} \pm z_{\alpha/2}\frac{s}{\sqrt{N}}$$

Where $s$ is the sample standard deviation and $z_{\alpha/2}$ is the critical value.

## Modern Developments

### Machine Learning in Finance

Recent advances combine traditional mathematical finance with machine learning:

$$\text{Price} = f(\text{Features}) + \epsilon$$

Where $f$ is learned from data rather than derived from first principles.

### High-Frequency Trading

In high-frequency trading, the focus is on:

$$\text{Profit} = \sum_{i=1}^n (P_i - P_{i-1}) \cdot Q_i$$

Where $P_i$ are prices and $Q_i$ are quantities at time $i$.

## Conclusion

Mathematical finance continues to evolve, incorporating new techniques from machine learning, high-frequency data analysis, and computational methods. The fundamental principles remain grounded in rigorous mathematical theory, ensuring that financial models are both theoretically sound and practically applicable.

The key challenge remains balancing mathematical elegance with real-world applicability, ensuring that models capture the essential features of financial markets while remaining computationally tractable.
